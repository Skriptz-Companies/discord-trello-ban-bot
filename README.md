# Disello Ban Bot

This bot was made by Deoelopve#4875 for the express use for City of Charleston on roblox. Run by Camer_939. 
This bot can be used to allow administrator in a discord guild to be able to execute a command (ban) that will add a users name and user id to a trello list. 
With integration to adonis admin, you can ban anyone with this command. This bot does access the roblox API services to allow just for username imput and no user id imput, along with card formating

# Updates Coming Soon
- Role specified access. (To allow for access in a public guild to only certain users.)
- A "checkban" command. (To allow for users to check the ban list in discord.)
- A ban reason, and a log on who banned what users. (To prevent abuse and full completion logging on trello.
- Trello card content imporvments. ^^^
- Possible date to the trello card, or automatically moving the trello card upon expiration of the date.
- Possible paid access support only. (To help fund future projects.)
